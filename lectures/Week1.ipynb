For as in those games there were some persons whose object was glory and the honor of a crown, to be attained by the performance of bodily exercises, so others were led thither by the gain of buying and selling, and mere views of profit; but there was likewise one class of persons, and they were by far the best, whose aim was neither applause nor profit, but who came merely as spectators through curiosity, to observe what was done, and to see in what manner things were carried on there. And thus, said he, we come from another life and nature unto this one, just as men come out of some other city, to some much frequented mart; some being slaves to glory, others to money; and there are some few who, taking no account of anything else, earnestly look into the nature of things; and these men call themselves studious of wisdom, that is, philosophers: and as there it is the most reputable occupation of all to be a looker-on without making any acquisition, so in life, the contemplating things, and acquainting one\\\\u2019s self with them, greatly exceeds every other pursuit of life.\\\\u201d}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cameron|first=Alister|title=The Pythagorean Background of the theory of Recollection|publisher=George Banta Publishing Company|year=1938}}</ref> others dispute this story,<ref>Jaeger, W. \\'On the Origin and Cycle of the Philosophic Ideal of Life.\\' First published in Sitzungsberichte der preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, philosophisch-historishce Klasse, 1928; Eng.

Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.\\\\\" (p. 666).</ref>\\\\n\\\\nHistorically, \\'\\'philosophy\\'\\' encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a \\'\\'[[philosopher]]\\'\\'.<ref name=\\\\\":0\\\\\">\\\\\"The English word \\\\\"philosophy\\\\\" is first attested to c. 1300, meaning \\\\\"knowledge, body of knowledge.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n[[Douglas Harper|Harper, Douglas]]. 2020. \\\\\"[https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=philosophy philosophy (n.)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702125749/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=philosophy&searchmode=none |date=2 July 2017 }}.\\\\\" \\'\\'[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]\\'\\'.

The ancient era was dominated by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophical schools]]. Most notable among the schools influenced by Socrates\\' teachings were [[Plato]], who founded the [[Platonic Academy]], and his student [[Aristotle]],<ref name=\\\\\"process\\\\\" /> who founded the [[Peripatetic school]]. Other ancient philosophical traditions influenced by Socrates included [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaicism]], [[Stoicism]], and [[Academic Skepticism]]. Two other traditions were influenced by Socrates\\' contemporary, [[Democritus]]: [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Epicureanism]]. Important topics covered by the Greeks included [[metaphysics]] (with competing theories such as [[atomism]] and [[monism]]), [[cosmology]], the nature of the well-lived life (\\'\\'[[eudaimonia]]\\'\\'), the [[Epistemology|possibility of knowledge]], and the nature of reason ([[logos]]). With the rise of the [[Roman empire]], Greek philosophy was increasingly discussed in [[Latin]] by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] such as [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (see [[Roman philosophy]]).\\\\n\\\\n==== Medieval era ====\\\\n[[Medieval philosophy]] (5th\\\\u201316th centuries) is the period following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and was dominated by the rise of [[Christianity]] and hence reflects [[Judeo-Christian]] theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of [[God]], the nature of [[faith]] and reason, metaphysics, the [[problem of evil]] were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include [[St. Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] and [[Roger Bacon]]. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to [[Theology]] ({{Lang-la|ancilla theologiae|label=none}}) and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of [[Scholasticism]], a text critical method developed in [[medieval universities]] based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The [[Renaissance]] period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust [[Humanism]].\\\\n\\\\n==== Modern era ====\\\\n[[File:Kant doerstling2.jpg|thumb|A painting of the influential modern philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (in the blue coat) with his friends.

Major modern philosophers include [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].\\\\n\\\\n[[19th-century philosophy]] (sometimes called [[late modern philosophy]]) was influenced by the wider 18th-century movement termed \\\\\"[[the Enlightenment]]\\\\\", and includes figures such as [[Hegel]] a key figure in [[German idealism]], [[Kierkegaard]] who developed the foundations for [[existentialism]], [[Nietzsche]] a famed anti-Christian, [[John Stuart Mill]] who promoted [[utilitarianism]], [[Karl Marx]] who developed the foundations for [[communism]] and the American [[William James]]. The 20th century saw the split between [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]], as well as philosophical trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[logical positivism]], [[pragmatism]] and the [[linguistic turn]] (see [[Contemporary philosophy]]).\\\\n\\\\n=== Middle Eastern philosophy ===\\\\n{{Main|Middle Eastern philosophy}}\\\\n\\\\n==== Pre-Islamic philosophy ====\\\\nThe regions of the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Iran]] and [[Arabia]] are home to the earliest known philosophical wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by [[Islamic culture]].\\\\n\\\\nEarly [[Wisdom literature|Wisdom Literature]] from the Fertile Crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs. In [[Ancient Egypt]], these texts were known as \\'\\'[[sebayt]]\\'\\' (\\'teachings\\') and they are central to our understandings of [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy]]. [[Babylonian astronomy]] also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks.\\\\n\\\\n[[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]] are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the [[Tanakh]]) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the [[Geonim]] of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]] and [[Maimonides]] engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] who ushered in the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment), [[Jewish existentialism]], and [[Reform Judaism]].\\\\n\\\\nThe various traditions of [[Gnosticism]], which were influenced by both Greek and Abrahamic currents, originated around the first century and emphasized spiritual knowledge (\\'\\'[[gnosis]]\\'\\').\\\\n\\\\nPre-Islamic [[Iranian philosophy]] begins with the work of [[Zoroaster]], one of the first promoters of [[monotheism]] and of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as [[Manichaeism]], [[Mazdakism]], and [[Zurvanism]].\\\\n\\\\n==== Islamic philosophy ====\\\\n{{See also|Islamic philosophy|}}[[File:Avicenna_Portrait_on_Silver_Vase_-_Museum_at_BuAli_Sina_(Avicenna)_Mausoleum_-_Hamadan_-_Western_Iran_(7423560860).jpg|right|thumb|An Iranian portrait of [[Avicenna]] on a Silver Vase. He was one of the most influential philosophers of the [[Islamic Golden Age]].]]\\\\n[[Islamic philosophy]] is the philosophical work originating in the [[Islamic culture|Islamic tradition]] and is mostly done in [[Arabic]]. It draws from the religion of Islam as well as from Greco-Roman philosophy. After the [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Translation Movement|translation movement]] (mid-eighth to the late tenth century) resulted in the works of Greek philosophy becoming available in Arabic.<ref>Gutas, Dimitri (1998).

Routledge. pp. 1\\\\u201326.</ref>\\\\n\\\\n[[Early Islamic philosophy]] developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This intellectual work inaugurated what is known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are [[Kalam]], which focuses on [[Islamic theology]], and [[Falsafa]], which was based on [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The work of Aristotle was very influential among philosophers such as [[Al-Kindi]] (9th century), [[Avicenna]] (980 \\\\u2013 June 1037) and [[Averroes]] (12th century). Others such as [[Al-Ghazali]] were highly critical of the methods of the Islamic Aristotelians and saw their metaphysical ideas as heretical. Islamic thinkers like [[Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Al-Biruni]] also developed a [[scientific method]], experimental medicine, a theory of optics and a legal philosophy. [[Ibn Khaldun]] was an influential thinker in [[philosophy of history]].\\\\n\\\\nIslamic thought also deeply influenced European intellectual developments, especially through the commentaries of Averroes on Aristotle. The [[Mongol invasions of the Levant|Mongol invasions]] and the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destruction of Baghdad]] in 1258 is often seen as marking the end of the Golden Age.<ref>Cooper, William W.; Yue, Piyu (2008). \\'\\'Challenges of the Muslim world: present, future and past.\\'\\' Emerald Group Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-444-53243-5}}.

Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends.

It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer\\'s part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step.<ref name = \\\\\"Alpaydin2020\\\\\">{{cite book\\\\n | author = Ethem Alpaydin \\\\n | title =Introduction to Machine Learning\\\\n | year = 2020\\\\n | edition = Fourth\\\\n | pages = xix, 1\\\\u20133, 13\\\\u201318\\\\n | publisher = [[MIT]]\\\\n |isbn = 978-0262043793\\\\n }}</ref>\\\\n\\\\nThe discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available. In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid. This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers. For example, to train a system for the task of digital character recognition, the [[MNIST database|MNIST]] dataset of handwritten digits has often been used.<ref name = \\\\\"Alpaydin2020\\\\\"/>\\\\n\\\\n== History and relationships to other fields ==\\\\n{{See also|Timeline of machine learning}}\\\\nThe term \\'\\'machine learning\\'\\' was coined in 1959 by [[Arthur Samuel]], an American [[IBMer]] and pioneer in the field of [[computer gaming]] and [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\\\\\"Samuel\\\\\">{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Arthur|date=1959|title=Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=3|issue=3|pages=210\\\\u2013229|doi=10.1147/rd.33.0210|citeseerx=10.1.1.368.2254}}</ref><ref>R.

Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \\\\\"unsupervised learning\\\\\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, [[ECML PKDD]] being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to \\'\\'reproduce known\\'\\' knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously \\'\\'unknown\\'\\' knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\\\\n\\\\n=== Optimization ===\\\\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some [[loss function]] on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Le Roux |first1=Nicolas |first2=Yoshua |last2=Bengio |first3=Andrew |last3=Fitzgibbon |title=Improving First and Second-Order Methods by Modeling Uncertainty |encyclopedia=Optimization for Machine Learning |year=2012 |page=404 |editor1-last=Sra |editor1-first=Suvrit |editor2-first=Sebastian |editor2-last=Nowozin |editor3-first=Stephen J. |editor3-last=Wright |publisher=MIT Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPQx7s2L1A8C&q=\\\\\"Improving+First+and+Second-Order+Methods+by+Modeling+Uncertainty&pg=PA403|isbn=9780262016469 }}</ref>\\\\n\\\\n=== Generalization ===\\\\nThe difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.

The [[bias\\\\u2013variance decomposition]] is one way to quantify generalization [[Errors and residuals|error]].\\\\n\\\\nFor the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases.

Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\\\\n\\\\n== Approaches ==\\\\n\\\\n{{Anchor|Algorithm types}}\\\\nMachine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the \\\\\"signal\\\\\" or \\\\\"feedback\\\\\" available to the learning system:\\\\n* [[Supervised learning]]: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \\\\\"teacher\\\\\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] inputs to outputs.\\\\n* [[Unsupervised learning]]: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ([[feature learning]]).\\\\n* [[Reinforcement learning]]: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as [[Autonomous car|driving a vehicle]] or playing a game against an opponent).

Such systems \\\\\"learn\\\\\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\\\\n\\\\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \\\\\"[[artificial neuron]]s\\\\\", which loosely model the [[neuron]]s in a biological [[brain]]. Each connection, like the [[synapse]]s in a biological [[brain]], can transmit information, a \\\\\"signal\\\\\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a [[real number]], and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \\\\\"edges\\\\\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a [[weight (mathematics)|weight]] that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\\\\n\\\\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a [[human brain]] would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from [[biology]]. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[machine translation]], [[social network]] filtering, [[general game playing|playing board and video games]] and [[medical diagnosis]].\\\\n\\\\n[[Deep learning]] consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network.

It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, [[leaf node|leaves]] represent class labels and branches represent [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]s of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically [[real numbers]]) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and [[decision making]]. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.\\\\n\\\\n==== Support-vector machines ====\\\\n{{Main|Support-vector machine}}\\\\nSupport-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related [[supervised learning]] methods used for classification and regression.

Its most common form is [[linear regression]], where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as [[ordinary least squares]]. The latter is often extended by [[regularization (mathematics)]] methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in [[ridge regression]]. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include [[polynomial regression]] (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Christopher|title=Tutorial: Polynomial Regression in Excel|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~cstevens/301/Excel4.html|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref>), [[logistic regression]] (often used in [[statistical classification]]) or even [[kernel regression]], which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the [[kernel trick]] to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\\\\n\\\\n==== Bayesian networks ====\\\\n{{Main|Bayesian network}}\\\\n[[Image:SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg|thumb|right|A simple Bayesian network.

For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform [[inference]] and learning.

In comparison, the K-fold-[[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]], which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kohavi|first1=Ron|title=A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation and Model Selection|journal=International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence|date=1995|url=http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/cs573/Papers/Kohavi-IJCAI-95.pdf}}</ref>\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report [[sensitivity and specificity]] meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the [[false positive rate]] (FPR) as well as the [[false negative rate]] (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The [[total operating characteristic]] (TOC) is an effective method to express a model\\'s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used [[receiver operating characteristic]] (ROC) and ROC\\'s associated area under the curve (AUC).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pontius|first1=Robert Gilmore|last2=Si|first2=Kangping|title=The total operating characteristic to measure diagnostic ability for multiple thresholds| journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|volume=28|issue=3|year=2014|pages=570\\\\u2013583|doi=10.1080/13658816.2013.862623|s2cid=29204880}}</ref>\\\\n\\\\n== Ethics ==\\\\n{{See also|AI control problem}}\\\\nMachine learning poses a host of [[Machine ethics|ethical questions]].

The liberals favor the American model and share the view that the Soviet model has become archaic and should be totally abandoned. Meanwhile, democratic socialism in Sweden provided an alternative model. Its sustained economic development and extensive welfare programs fascinated many. Numerous scholars within the democratic socialist camp argue that China should model itself politically and economically on Sweden, which is viewed as more genuinely socialist than China.

The original utopian socialists condemned this doctrine of individualism for failing to address social concerns during the [[Industrial Revolution]], including [[poverty]], [[oppression]] and vast [[wealth inequality]]. They viewed their society as harming community life by basing society on competition.

They elected a Commune council of 92 members, one member for each 20,000 residents.<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, \\'\\'La Commune de Paris\\'\\'.

It reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular and highly democratic [[social democracy]].\\\\n\\\\nBecause the Commune was able to meet on fewer than 60 days in total, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included the [[separation of church and state]]; the remission of rents owed for the period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended); the abolition of [[Shift work|night work]] in the hundreds of Paris [[bakeries]]; the granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of National Guards killed on active service; and the free return of all workmen\\'s tools and household items valued up to 20 francs that had been pledged during the siege.<ref name=\\\\\"Milza, Pierre, La Commune\\\\\">Milza, Pierre, \\'\\'La Commune\\'\\'.</ref> The Commune was concerned that skilled workers had been forced to pawn their tools during the war; the postponement of commercial [[debt]] obligations and the abolition of interest on the debts; and the [[workers\\' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner.

A planned economy can be either decentralised or centralised. [[Enrico Barone]] provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gregory and Stuart|first=Paul and Robert|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition|publisher=George Hoffman|year=2004|isbn=978-0-618-26181-9|pages=120\\\\u201321}}</ref>\\\\n\\\\nThe most prominent example of a planned economy was the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system of the Soviet Union]] and as such the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as \\\\\"command economies\\\\\", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ericson|first=Richard E.|title=Command Economy|url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|access-date=9 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125010605/http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. Instead of conscious planning, the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. Planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an \\\\\"administered\\\\\" or \\\\\"managed\\\\\" economy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nove|first=Alec|title=The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=978-0-04-335049-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsoffeasi00nove/page/78 78]|quote=Several authors of the most diverse political views have stated that there is in fact no planning in the Soviet Union: Eugene Zaleski, J.

Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favour of decentralised planning. He argued that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people in the economy. As a result, central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions.<ref>\\'\\'Writings 1932\\\\u201333, p. 96\\'\\', Leon Trotsky.</ref> [[State socialism]] is unfeasible in this view because information cannot be aggregated by a central body and effectively used to formulate a plan for an entire economy, because doing so would result in [[Economic calculation problem|distorted or absent price signals]].<ref name=\\\\\"hayek\\\\\">F.

The profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees, collectively sustain the enterprise or finance public institutions.<ref>\\'\\'Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century\\'\\', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. p. 142: \\\\\"It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large.\\\\\"</ref> In state-oriented forms of market socialism, in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit, the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a [[social dividend]], eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems.

Socialism, in Walras\\'s view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition.

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Some democratic socialists support social democracy as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is relegated to the indefinite future. According to [[Sheri Berman]], Marxism is loosely held to be valuable for its emphasis on changing the world for a more just, better future.<ref>Berman, Sheri (2006). \\'\\'The Primacy of Politics: Social Democracy and the Making of Europe\\'s Twentieth Century\\'\\'.

The major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics in that contemporary social democrats support a welfare state and unemployment insurance as well as other practical, progressive reforms of capitalism and are more concerned to administrate and humanise it. On the other hand, democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to humanise capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|year=2006|url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archive-date=17 June 2012}} \\\\\"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\\\\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance.

During the [[Prohibition in the United States|American Prohibition]], the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s and saloons.\\\\n\\\\n[[File:Children in the Ghetto and the Ice-Cream Man. Chicago Ill.

There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: [[Howard Johnson\\'s]] restaurants advertised \\\\\"a world of 28 flavors\\\\\", and [[Baskin-Robbins]] made its 31 flavors (\\\\\"one for every day of the month\\\\\") the cornerstone of its [[marketing strategy]] (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties).\\\\n\\\\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of [[soft serve|soft ice cream]], which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs.

Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion that has dispersed phase as fat globules. The emulsion is turned into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. The triacylglycerols in fat are [[Chemical polarity|non polar]] and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as [[casein]] and [[whey]] protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can [[adsorb]] water and form [[micelles]] which will contribute to its consistency. The proteins contribute to the emulsification, aeration and texture. [[Sucrose]] which is [[disaccharide]] is usually used as a sweetening agent. [[Lactose]] which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will remain unfrozen and will not give a hard texture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/Courses/ce457_527/ce457_pro/Colloidal%20and%20surface%20phenomenal%20aspects%20of%20Ice%20cream.doc|title=Colloidal and surface phenomenal aspects of ice cream}}</ref> Too much lactose will result in a non ideal texture because of either excessive freezing point depression or lactose crystallization.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ullmann\\'s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |chapter=Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts}}</ref>\\\\n\\\\n== Production ==\\\\n[[File:EismaschineBoku.JPG|left|thumb|A Boku Europa [[ice cream maker]] in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]]]]\\\\nBefore the development of modern [[refrigeration]], ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]], insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. [[Frederic Tudor]] of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\\\\n\\\\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/three-ways-to-make-homemade-ice-cream|date=November 21, 2016|title=Three ways to make homemade ice cream|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a {{interlanguage link|sorbeti\\\\u00e8re|fr}} (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing [[latent heat]] and bringing the mixture below the [[freezing point]] of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.\\\\n\\\\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson\\'s design.\\\\n\\\\nIn Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\\\\n\\\\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer [[Carl von Linde]] during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\\\\n\\\\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an [[ice cream maker]], an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add [[liquid nitrogen]] to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by [[Heston Blumenthal]] as ideal for home cooks, is to add [[dry ice]] to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Eggs |series=How to Cook Like Heston |first=Heston |last=Blumenthal |network=[[Channel 4]] |series-no=1 |number= 02 }}</ref> Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.\\\\n\\\\nBorden\\'s [[Eagle Brand]] sweetened condensed milk circulated a recipe for making ice cream at home.

The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an \\'ice cream man\\', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an [[ice cream van]]. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\\\\n\\\\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \\\\\"[[ice cream van|ice cream trucks]]\\\\\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children\\'s music or folk melodies (such as \\\\\"[[Turkey in the Straw]]\\\\\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays.
